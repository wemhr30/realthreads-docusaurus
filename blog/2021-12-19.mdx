# Week Ending 19 Dec 2021

Hosted Docusaurus site on Netlify. Set up a database to capture page view reports on Heroku. Used IBM Watson Studio to convert speech to text and translate between languages.

## Docusaurus on Netlify
I hosted the Docusaurus site on Netlify and used Cloudflare to configure DNS settings for a new subdomain. The site is available at [stories.realthreads.io](https://stories.realthreads.io/).

I used the 'Import Existing Project' option in Netlify to connect to the GitHub repo. The build failed first time due to a broken link. The log showed exactly where the broken link was, so it was easy to locate and fix. Now the tests run in GitHub when I create a new pull request, the tests run in GitHub which is handy.

## Python Getting Started App
I made some changes to the look and feel of Python Getting Started app hosted on Heroku at [realthreads.io](http://realthreads.io/). I also added the [papertrail](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#provision-add-ons) logging add-on and created the required tables using manage.py migrate. The app now includes a simple [Page View Report](https://realthreads.io/db/) with data stored in the Postgres database.

## Python course
I completed week 3 & 4 of the IBM Python Course. The exercises included setting up an account with IBM Cloud and using IBM Watson Studio to [convert speech to text](https://gist.github.com/wemhr30/faf27fc4f7275e610bef009e5f891085) and translate between languages.
