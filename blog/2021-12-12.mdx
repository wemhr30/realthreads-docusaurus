# Week Ending 12 Dec 2021

Hosted Python Getting Started app on Heroku. Explored Django and Postgres. Started creating a blog with Docusaurus. Created a colour palette and some icons.

## Heroku
I promoted the Python-Getting-Started app from local, through review, staging and to production. Following the tutorial, I also added a Postgres database to each of the apps.

I had some problems getting heroku local web to point to local Postgres (see Postgres below) - or validating that it is. I don’t know if this is a problem or not. The main impact so far is that in the tutorial, I [set up a logging service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#provision-add-ons) that writes a greeting log to the database. The [log is accessed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#provision-a-database) from the url site/db. It works as intended in production, but throws an error locally because the table doesn’t exist.


## Django
The front end framework for the python-getting-started app is Django. The only problem so far was that I couldn’t get the static files (e.g. python logo) to render when running locally. [It seems](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/#serving-static-files-during-development) I might need to be running something extra locally to serve static files in Django.

## Postgres
Installed Postgres locally. All seemed to be fine. Ran the command

	$ createdb python_getting_started

locally and can see the db, but not sure if it’s actually used when running 

	$ herko local web 
	
from Python-getting-started - the logging db url doesn't work. Need to do more research.

## Look and feel
Downloaded Vectornator for iPhone and drew a thread logo. Exported this as an .svg file and created a set of .ico assets using an online converter.
Used Adobe online colour wheel tool to generate a set of complimentary and contrasting colours. Tested these in light and dark modes using Keynote.
Created a set of simple chart templates in Keynote. Exported these to PDF and converted to SVG online.

## Docusaurus
Started tweaking the markdown and static files to change images, look and feel etc.
Added a blog and transferred content created in iA Writer to the the site. 

## Python
Completed [week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai/home/week/2).  

## Project
Thinking of three parts:
* Data projects in Python hosted on Heroku at [realthreads.io](http://realthreads.io/)
* Docs and commentary in Docusauraus hosted on Netifly at [stories.realthreads.io](http://docs.realthreads.io/)
* Random miscellaneous projects in Next.js on Threads Central hosted on Netlify at [threadscentral.io](https://threadscentral.io/)
